#!/usr/bin/env bash
# restart.sh — Safely restart cc-connect, even when called from within cc-connect.
#
# Uses systemd-run to schedule the actual restart as a transient unit, fully
# detached from the calling process tree. This means cc-connect can die
# (as expected) and the restart still completes.
#
# Usage:
#   ./restart.sh              # restart only, keeping the current binary
#   ./restart.sh --deploy     # build, backup current binary, install, restart,
#                             # health-check, rollback on failure.
#
# --deploy contract:
#   - The script owns the build. Callers do NOT copy a binary into place
#     themselves — that caused a past incident where `cp broken $BINARY`
#     then running --deploy backed up the broken file as "known-good" AND
#     installed the broken file, leaving both the live binary and the
#     rollback target corrupted at the same time.
#   - Build happens in the FOREGROUND so compilation errors are surfaced
#     to the caller immediately. $BINARY is never touched if the build fails.
#   - The backup step in the detached phase captures $BINARY BEFORE the
#     new binary replaces it — the backup is the rollback TARGET, not the
#     thing we are rolling forward TO.
#   - Install uses `install -m 0755` so mode is explicit every time.
#     `cp` over an existing file preserves the destination's mode, which
#     can silently strip the execute bit if the file was ever touched
#     to 0664. `install` creates a fresh file with the mode we specify.
#
# Ownership notes:
#   - $BINARY and $BACKUP must be writable by the invoking user. If they
#     end up owned by a non-leigh user (e.g. after a partseeker-coder
#     session operated in this directory), fix ownership first:
#       sudo chown leigh:partseeker-dev cc-connect cc-connect.known-good
#     The script cannot fix this itself — it has no sudo.
